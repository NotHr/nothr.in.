      <description>&lt;p&gt;It’s been a year that I have been daily driving Linux as my main machine. So far, the journey has been great. I have come to know a lot of things and have been using many FOSS tools.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I have tried a few main distros like Debian, Ubuntu, Fedora, and Arch. I liked Fedora and Arch because they are fast and good. Finally, I have chosen Arch over Fedora because I like the package manager and the rolling release.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;After giving it a lot of thought I have made it clear that, If I need to learn someting I have to make changes to my daily routine. So I had to give up games because but due to some reason I can’t give them up, so I have changed my OS to Arch Linux. It might sound cool but Its hard to enable and configure services.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
