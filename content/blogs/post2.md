It’s been a year that I have been daily driving Linux as my main machine. So far, the journey has been great. I have come to know a lot of things and have been using many FOSS tools.

I have tried a few main distros like Debian, Ubuntu, Fedora, and Arch. I liked Fedora and Arch because they are fast and good. Finally, I have chosen Arch over Fedora because I like the package manager and the rolling release.

I started with Gnome as my WM, later moved to KDE, but I feel like both are bloated, and I need to use my mouse every time to do something. I tried DWM, but I feel like it’s not for me. Then, one of my friends suggested i3, which is so good and suited my needs. Currently, I use i3. I am very fascinated by how this works.

Later, I found some tools which I use a lot. autocpu-freq is one of the programs which increased my battery life significantly.
