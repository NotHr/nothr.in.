Hello, I am Harshith, a Junior from GITAM Hyderabad, a Linux and FOSS enthusiast.

I daily drive Arch Linux (I use Arch btw). I love to tinker with my system.

I use a lot of tools like \(LaTeX\) and \(Pandoc\). Most of the time, you can find my tools [here](/tools/).

I also own a VPS where I host this website and a few other things. I have a home-server where I host a few important services.

You can mail me or contact me on Matrix.
